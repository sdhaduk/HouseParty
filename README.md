# HouseParty

## Description
* I created this project because I was curious how creating a backend with python-django differed from node.js
* The application allows users to create a "room" that can be joined by other users. After authenticating with your Spotify account,
  this room displays the music you are playing on Spotify and allows users in the room to either skip or pause the song depending on the
  settings of the host
* The frontend communicates with the backend in order to make requests to the Spotify web API or get data from user sessions.

### Used:
* Python-Django
* React
* Spotify-WebAPI
