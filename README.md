# HouseParty

## Description
* I created this project because I was curious about how different creating a backend with python-django was compared to node.js
* The application allows users to create a "room" that can be joined by other users. After authenticating with your Spotify account,
  this room displays the music you are playing on spotify, and allows users in the room to either skip or pause the song.
* The frontend communicates with the backend in order to make requests to the spotify web-API or get data from user sessions.

### Used:
* Python-Django
* React
* Spotify-WebAPI
